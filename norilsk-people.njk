<h1>The kindness of the people of Norilsk knows no boundaries.</h1>

    <h2>Angels and Saints</h2>
    <p>
        The people of Norilsk are saints not yet canonized. Long hours of work in nickel mines bring them a modest
        paycheck, much of which is donated to charity. If you ever decide to visit the city of Norilsk, there is no need
        to bring food or money. A Norilsk smelter operator would give his last potato to a hungry traveler.
    </p>

    <h2>Peace and Tolerance</h2>
    <p>
        Not a single criminal can be found here. Those who do arrive with a checkered past are so amazed by the kindness
        and beauty of Norilsk’s inhabitants that they themselves are set straight. Not a single act of crime has been
        committed within the last one hundred years.
    </p>

    <h2>Love and Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        Doors are never locked and during the summer months are left wide open. Residents of an apartment building are
        free to eat from each others refrigerator, sit on their couch and watch television. If a large sum of money is
        found under the homeowner's mattress, it may be taken, then returned, or not, it doesn’t matter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Norilskites are not bothered by the trivial pursuit of wealth accumulation. To the decadent Westerner, these
        feats of human kindness seem impossible, like something out of a science-fiction workers' utopia novel. In Norilsk
        it is reality. The people of Norilsk live on a higher plane of consciousness, one of boundless love and sharing.
    </p>

    <h2>Diversity and Multiculturalism</h2>
    <p>
        Immigrants arrive in Norilsk from all over the former Soviet Union and the world. After the 2008 financial
        crisis, thousands of American refugees fled to Norilsk in search of a better life and a piece of the Russian
        Dream. Most live on the west side of town in what has become a vibrant immigrant community. They are free to carry
        on the corporate holiday traditions of their homeland with no fear of persecution from their Russian hosts. The
        Superbowl, Valentines Day, Wrestlemania and Easter Breakfast at McDonalds are celebrated with no less intensity
        and zeal.
